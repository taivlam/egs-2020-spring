# EGS - Spring 2020

This is some work I did for EGS 202 (Dynamics) and EGS 204 (Strength of Materials) during Spring 2020.

## Description

It turns out I am quite bad at preserving my own digital files, so I must keep a copy of it somewhere else so that I may still have it - even if I lose all of my files due to human error.

I had recovered most of my work by copying and pasting my command history from my MATLAB Online account.

### A Tip for Retriving Command History from MATLAB Online

Since MATLAB Online is not hacking friendly (as in tinkering, not reverse-engineering you dingus!), you cannot use the method of retriving command history as one usually does with a local installation of MATLAB via an XML file.

Instead, I discovered a "no tech" hack to retriving all of your MATLAB online command line history that works well, especially if you have fewer than 100 lines of command history:

1)  Simply hold the `Shift` key while holding the `â†‘` Up Arrow key until all of your command history is in the "current line".
2)  Then, copy and paste the entire command history using `Ctrl`+`C` and paste in a text editor window instance to remove any unwanted lines.

As you can see, there is always a way to make most things work in Linux if you invest enough time into it more than 99% of the time...

## Original Work

My original work that I turned in is located in the `Original` directory.  (I finally found my original work, after slightly organizing my storage devices.)
